# Learnings

Running list of project discoveries, gotchas, architectural decisions, and things that were harder than expected. Both Frederic and Claude append here.

## Gateway / Protocol

- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** `client.id` must come from a hardcoded enum in the gateway — custom IDs are rejected. Falcon Dash uses `openclaw-control-ui`.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** `allowInsecureAuth` only auto-approves Control UI connections, not backend/agent connections. Agent backend pairing is a separate process.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** Tool stream events require declaring `caps: ["tool-events"]` in the connect frame. Without it, tool events are silently dropped by the gateway.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** The connect frame uses string ID `'__connect'` (not numeric) to avoid collision with `RequestCorrelator`'s monotonic counter. Do not change this to a numeric ID.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** `webchat-ui` as client ID triggers `isWebchatClient()=true` regardless of mode — never use it for operator dashboards.

## Agent streams

- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** Tool events use `data.phase` (not `data.type`). Phases: `start`, `update`, `result`.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** Tool events can arrive before the `chat.send` RPC response — `handleMessageStart` creates an assistant placeholder early to prevent a race condition.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** Thinking events use `stream: "thinking"` (not `stream: "assistant"`). Fields: `data.text` (accumulated), `data.delta` (incremental).

## PM / context pipeline

- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** `BOOTSTRAP.md` lives at `{workspace}/.falcon-dash/BOOTSTRAP.md`, loaded by `bootstrap-extra-files` hook, not by Falcon Dash itself.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** `sync-peers.sh` self-heals: it recreates `BOOTSTRAP.md` if the file is missing or lacks `<!-- PEERS:START -->` / `<!-- PEERS:END -->` markers.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** On new agent creation, only `mkdir` the workspace directory — no need to provision `BOOTSTRAP.md` manually.

## Dev environment

- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** No `.env` file is needed in local dev — gateway config is read from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` via the `/api/gateway-config` endpoint.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** Use `journalctl --user -u openclaw-gateway` for gateway logs. The `openclaw logs` command requires its own device pairing and is less practical.
- **2026-02-25 (Claude, seeded):** `window.__oc` exposes `call`, `connection`, `snapshot`, `eventBus`, and `canvasStore` for runtime debugging in the browser console.
