# Documents

The Documents page lets you browse, view, and edit files in your agent's workspace. This is the same set of files that your agent reads and writes as it works.

## Browsing files

When you open Documents, you see a file list showing all files and folders in the current directory. Each row shows:

- The file or folder name with an icon indicating its type.
- When it was last modified (shown as a relative time like "5 minutes ago").
- The file size.

Click a folder to open it and see its contents. A breadcrumb trail at the top of the page shows where you are in the folder structure. Click any part of the breadcrumb to jump back to that level.

You can search for files by name using the search box in the toolbar.

The file list can be sorted by name, modification date, or size. Click a column header to change the sort order.

## Viewing a file

Click any file to open it in a viewer. Markdown files are rendered with full formatting, including syntax-highlighted code blocks, math formulas, and diagrams. Other text files are shown as plain text.

## Editing a file

Falcon Dash includes a built-in text editor. When viewing a file, you can edit its contents directly in the browser.

You can also use the toolbar to:

- **Create a new file** -- click "+ File" and enter a name.
- **Create a new folder** -- click "+ Folder" and enter a name.
- **Upload files** -- click "Upload" or drag and drop files onto the page.
- **Rename** -- hover over a file and click the rename icon, or right-click a file and choose "Rename."
- **Copy path** -- right-click a file and choose "Copy Path" to copy the file path to your clipboard.
- **Download** -- hover over a file and click the download icon, or right-click and choose "Download."
- **Delete** -- hover over a file and click the delete icon, or right-click and choose "Delete." You will be asked to confirm before anything is removed.

## Working with multiple files

You can select multiple files using the checkboxes on the left side of each row. Hold Shift and click to select a range. Once you have a selection, a toolbar appears with options to:

- Download the selected files.
- Move them to a different folder.
- Delete them all at once.

## What files are visible

The Documents page shows files from your agent's workspace -- the directory where your agent stores its working files, notes, and outputs. These are the same files your agent can read and modify during conversations.
