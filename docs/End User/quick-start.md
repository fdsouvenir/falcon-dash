# Getting started with Falcon Dash

This guide walks you through opening Falcon Dash, connecting to your agent, and having your first conversation. It should take less than five minutes.

## Open Falcon Dash

Open the URL that Fredbot Hosting provided to you in your web browser. You can use any modern browser on a computer or phone -- Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge all work.

## Enter your access key

When you first open Falcon Dash, you will see a login screen titled "Self-Hosted" with a connection form.

1. In the "Gateway Token" field, paste the access key that Fredbot provided to you.
2. Leave the "Gateway URL" field as-is unless Fredbot gave you a different URL.
3. Click "Connect."

If you do not have an access key, contact Fredbot Hosting support and we will provide one.

## Device pairing

The first time you connect from a new device (computer, phone, or tablet), the system needs to verify that your device is authorized. You will see a "Waiting for device approval..." message with a pulsing yellow indicator.

This is normal. Fredbot Hosting will approve your device, usually within a few minutes. Once approved, Falcon Dash will automatically connect and you will not need to go through this step again on the same device.

If approval takes longer than expected, reach out to Fredbot support.

## Your first conversation

Once connected, you will see the main Falcon Dash interface. The connection indicator in the upper-left corner of the sidebar will show a green dot with "Connected."

To start chatting:

1. Look at the sidebar on the left. Under "Channels," you will see a channel called #general. Click on it.
2. The chat area will open with a welcome message: "How can I help you today?"
3. Type your message in the text box at the bottom and press Enter to send it.
4. Your agent will begin responding. You will see text appear as the agent works on its reply.

You can also click one of the suggestion chips -- like "Summarize a document" or "Help me brainstorm" -- to quickly send a starter message.

## Finding your way around the interface

Falcon Dash has a layout similar to Discord or Slack. Here is what each part does:

**Agent Rail (far-left vertical bar):** This narrow strip shows circular icons for each of your agents. Click an icon to switch to that agent. A green dot on an icon means that agent has active conversations. At the bottom of the rail, a "+" button lets you add a new agent.

**Sidebar (next to the agent rail):** This panel shows:

- Your agent's name and connection status at the top.
- "Channels" -- organized conversation spaces (like #general). Click a channel to open it.
- "Apps" -- links to other Falcon Dash features: Projects, Documents, Jobs, and Skills.
- At the bottom: Notifications, Settings, and Passwords.

**Main area (center/right):** This is where your conversation appears. Messages from you appear on the right side (on desktop), and agent responses appear on the left with the agent's name in purple.

## Using Falcon Dash on your phone

Falcon Dash works on mobile devices. The layout adjusts automatically:

- The agent rail and channel list appear as your home screen.
- Tapping a channel slides the chat view in from the right.
- A bottom tab bar provides quick access to Chat, Projects, Jobs, Docs, and Passwords.
- Tap the back arrow in the header to return to the channel list.

For a more app-like experience, you can install Falcon Dash to your home screen. See the mobile guide for instructions.
