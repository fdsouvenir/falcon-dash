# Channels

Channels are organized conversation spaces within each agent. They work similarly to channels in Discord or Slack -- each channel is a separate conversation thread where you can chat with your agent about a specific topic.

## What channels are for

Channels help you keep conversations organized. Instead of one long continuous chat, you can create separate channels for different topics, projects, or purposes. For example, you might have:

- A #general channel for everyday questions.
- A #website channel for discussions about your website.
- A #reports channel for requesting and reviewing reports.

Each agent has its own set of channels. When you switch agents in the Agent Rail, the channel list updates to show that agent's channels.

## The default channel

Every agent automatically gets a #general channel. This channel cannot be deleted, so there is always a place to start a conversation. You can rename it if you prefer a different name.

## Creating a channel

1. Look at the "Channels" section in the sidebar.
2. Click the "+" button next to the "Channels" heading.
3. A dialog appears asking for the channel name and an optional description.
4. Enter a name for your channel and click confirm.
5. The new channel is created and selected automatically, ready for you to start chatting.

Channel names appear with a # symbol in the sidebar.

## Switching between channels

Click any channel name in the sidebar to switch to it. The selected channel is highlighted, and the chat area updates to show that channel's conversation.

If a channel has unread messages, its name appears in bold white text with a blue badge showing the number of unread messages.

## Renaming a channel

1. Hover over the channel name in the sidebar.
2. A small pencil icon appears.
3. Click the pencil icon.
4. The channel name becomes an editable text field.
5. Type the new name and press Enter to save, or press Escape to cancel.

## Deleting a channel

1. Hover over the channel name in the sidebar.
2. An X icon appears (this does not appear for the default channel, which cannot be deleted).
3. Click the X icon.
4. A confirmation dialog appears explaining that the channel will be deleted and its transcript archived.
5. Click "Delete" to confirm, or "Cancel" to keep the channel.

Deleting a channel removes it from the sidebar. The conversation history is archived and no longer accessible from the interface.
