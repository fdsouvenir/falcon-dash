# Projects

The Projects page is where you track and monitor the work your agents are doing. Think of it as a project dashboard that your agents keep up to date on your behalf.

## Dashboard overview

When you open Projects, you see four summary cards at the top of the page:

- **Total** -- the total number of projects across all categories.
- **Active** -- how many projects are currently being worked on.
- **Due soon** -- projects with a deadline approaching in the next seven days.
- **Overdue** -- projects that have passed their due date.

Below the summary cards you may see attention items -- quick-access chips for projects that need your attention, such as those due soon. Click any chip to jump straight to that project.

## Filtering your project list

Use the filter pills just below the summary cards to change which projects appear in the list:

- **Active** -- shows projects that are to do, in progress, or in review. This is the default view.
- **All** -- shows every project regardless of status.
- **Done** -- shows completed projects.
- **Archived** -- shows archived and cancelled projects.

## How projects are organized

Projects are grouped into two levels:

- **Categories** (also called domains) -- broad areas of work, such as "Marketing" or "Engineering."
- **Sub-categories** (also called focuses) -- narrower areas within a category, such as "Content Writing" under "Marketing."

Each category header shows the number of projects it contains. Click a category or sub-category header to collapse or expand it.

Projects that do not belong to any known category appear in a flat "Other" section at the bottom of the list.

## Project statuses

Every project has a status that tells you where it stands:

- **to do** -- work has not started yet.
- **in progress** -- the project is actively being worked on.
- **review** -- the project is ready for your review.
- **done** -- the project is complete.
- **cancelled** -- the project was stopped before completion.
- **archived** -- the project has been filed away for reference.

Each status is shown as a colored pill next to the project title so you can scan the list at a glance.

## Priority levels

Projects can have a priority level that helps you see what matters most:

- **Urgent** -- shown with a red label. These are your highest priority items.
- **High** -- shown with an orange label.
- **Normal and low** -- no special indicator is displayed, keeping the list clean.

## Due dates

If a project has a deadline, it appears on the right side of each row. The text changes color to signal urgency:

- Red text and "overdue" for projects past their due date.
- Amber text for projects due today, tomorrow, or within the next seven days.
- Gray text with the calendar date for projects with more distant deadlines.

A dash is shown when no due date has been set.

## Viewing a project

Click any project in the list to open its detail view. The detail view opens as a panel on top of the list and includes:

- A header showing the category and sub-category breadcrumb, the project title, its status badge, priority badge, and due date.
- A short description if one has been provided.
- Two tabs:
  - **Status** -- displays the project body, which is a rich document that your agent writes and maintains. It can include formatted text, code samples, math formulas, and diagrams.
  - **Activity** -- a timeline of recent actions on the project, showing who did what and when.

## How agents update projects

Your agents write to and update projects on your behalf. When an agent updates a project's status, priority, body content, or other details, those changes appear in Falcon Dash in real time. You do not need to refresh the page.

The Activity tab records each change, so you have a full history of what happened and when.

## Navigation

The browser back button works naturally within the Projects page. Pressing back from a project detail view returns you to the project list. Pressing back again takes you to the previous page you were on in Falcon Dash.
