# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues you might encounter with Falcon Dash and how to resolve them.

## Cannot connect or stuck on "Connecting..."

If Falcon Dash shows "Connecting..." indefinitely or a red "Disconnected" status:

1. Check that you are connected to the internet.
2. Make sure you entered the correct access key. Click the connection status indicator in the sidebar header to open connection details. If it says "Auth Failed," click "Re-enter Token" and paste your access key again.
3. If you recently cleared your browser data, you may need to go through device pairing again. Wait a few minutes for Fredbot to approve your device, or contact support.
4. Try refreshing the page in your browser.
5. If the problem persists, contact Fredbot Hosting support with your device ID (shown on the login screen) so we can check your connection.

## Waiting for device approval

If you see "Waiting for device approval..." with a pulsing yellow dot:

This means your device has not been paired yet. This is expected when connecting from a new device or after clearing browser data. Fredbot Hosting needs to approve your device before you can connect.

Wait a few minutes. If approval does not come through, contact Fredbot Hosting support and let us know you are waiting for device pairing.

## Agent not responding

If you sent a message but your agent does not reply:

1. Check the connection status indicator. If it does not show a green dot with "Connected," your connection may have dropped. Wait for it to reconnect automatically, or refresh the page.
2. Look for a spinning indicator -- your agent may be thinking or using tools before responding. Some tasks take time to complete.
3. Try clicking the stop button (if visible) and sending your message again.
4. If the agent is consistently unresponsive, there may be an issue with the agent service. Contact Fredbot Hosting support.

## Messages not sending

If your messages show "Sending..." and never change to sent:

1. Check your connection status. Messages are queued when disconnected and will send automatically when the connection is restored.
2. If a message shows "Failed" with a red indicator, click "Retry" next to the message to try sending it again.
3. Make sure the channel you are in is still active. Try switching to a different channel and back.
4. Refresh the page and try again.

## Exec approval prompt not appearing

If your agent seems stuck and you suspect it is waiting for approval:

1. Check the bottom of the chat area -- approval prompts appear there.
2. On mobile, check for a bottom sheet that may have slid up from the bottom of the screen.
3. Check the notifications bell for any pending approval notifications.
4. If you are on a different page (like Projects or Documents), switch back to the Chat tab.

## Notifications not working

If you are not receiving notifications:

1. Make sure your browser has permission to show notifications. Check your browser's notification settings for the Falcon Dash URL.
2. On mobile, notifications work best when Falcon Dash is installed as an app on your home screen.
3. Check that the notification bell in the sidebar does not already have a badge -- you may have unread notifications waiting.
4. Try refreshing the page.

## Mobile layout issues

If the mobile interface is not displaying correctly:

1. Make sure you are using a recent version of your mobile browser (Safari on iPhone, Chrome on Android).
2. Try rotating your device to portrait orientation. Falcon Dash is designed for portrait mode on phones.
3. If the bottom tab bar is missing, the on-screen keyboard may be open. Dismiss the keyboard and it will reappear.
4. If elements are overlapping or cut off, close and reopen the browser or app.
5. Clear your browser cache for the Falcon Dash URL and reload.

## Chat history is missing

If a conversation appears empty when you know it had messages:

1. Wait a moment -- message history loads when you open a channel, and it may take a few seconds on a slow connection.
2. Check that you are looking at the correct agent and channel. Use the Agent Rail and channel list to verify.
3. If you recently deleted a channel, its history was archived and is no longer accessible.
4. Contact Fredbot Hosting support if you believe messages are missing unexpectedly.

## How to contact Fredbot Hosting support
