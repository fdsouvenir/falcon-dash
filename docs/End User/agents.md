# Working with agents

An agent is a specialized AI assistant that Fredbot Hosting has set up for you. Each agent has its own workspace, memory, and skills. You might have one agent that handles general tasks and another that specializes in a particular area of your business.

## The Agent Rail

The Agent Rail is the narrow vertical bar on the far left side of Falcon Dash. Each circle in the rail represents one of your agents. The circle shows either an emoji or the first letter of the agent's name.

Hover over an agent icon to see a tooltip with the agent's name and how many active channels or sessions it has.

## Switching between agents

Click an agent icon in the Agent Rail to switch to that agent. When you switch:

- The sidebar updates to show that agent's name at the top.
- The channel list updates to show channels for the selected agent.
- The active indicator (a white pill shape on the left edge) moves to show which agent is selected.
- The selected agent's icon changes from a circle to a rounded square shape with a blue background.

## Activity indicators

A small green dot in the bottom-right corner of an agent icon means that agent has active channels or sessions. This helps you quickly see which agents have ongoing conversations.

## Spawning a new agent

If you need an additional agent:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the Agent Rail.
2. Click the "+" button (a circle with a dashed border).
3. A confirmation popup appears next to the button asking "Spawn agent?"
4. Click "Spawn" to confirm, or "Cancel" to back out.
5. The new agent is created and appears in the rail. A toast notification confirms the creation.

New agents are assigned an automatic name (like "agent-001"). You can customize the name afterward in Settings.

## Customizing an agent's identity

To change an agent's name, emoji, or theme color:

1. Open Settings from the bottom of the sidebar.
2. Go to the Agents tab.
3. Find the agent in the list and click "Edit."
4. Set a name, emoji, and theme color.
5. Save your changes.

The agent's icon in the rail will update to reflect the new emoji, and its name will appear in the sidebar header and chat messages.

## Why you might have more than one agent

There are several reasons to use multiple agents:

- **Specialization:** One agent might handle customer communications while another manages internal projects.
- **Separation:** Keep different areas of work in separate agent workspaces so conversations and files do not mix.
- **Capacity:** If one agent is busy with a long-running task, you can work with another agent in the meantime.

Each agent operates independently with its own conversation history, files, and configuration. Your Fredbot Hosting setup determines how many agents are available and what each one is configured to do.
