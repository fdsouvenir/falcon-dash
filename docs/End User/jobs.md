# Scheduled jobs

Scheduled jobs let you automate tasks that your agent performs on a repeating basis. For example, you might set up a job that runs every morning to check for new data, generate a report, or send a summary.

## Viewing the jobs list

When you open the Jobs page, you see a table of all your scheduled jobs. Each row shows:

- **Name** -- the job name, along with an optional description.
- **Schedule** -- how often the job runs, shown in plain language when possible (for example, "every day at 9:00 AM").
- **Next run** -- when the job is expected to run next.
- **Last run** -- when the job last ran.
- **Status** -- whether the job is enabled, disabled, or encountered an error on its last run.

You can search jobs by name, description, or schedule using the search box at the top. Click the column headers for Name, Schedule, or Last Run to change the sort order.

## Creating a job

Click the "+ Create Job" button in the top right corner to open the job creation form. Fill in the job details including a name, an optional description, and a schedule. Once you save, the job will begin running at the times you specified.

## Running a job manually

If you want your agent to run a job right away instead of waiting for the next scheduled time, click the play button on that job's row. The agent will execute the job immediately.

## Viewing run history

Click the history icon on a job's row to see the chat session where the job's runs are recorded. This takes you to the corresponding conversation so you can review what the agent did and what it reported.

## Enabling and disabling jobs

Each job has an on/off toggle. Click it to enable or disable the job. A disabled job will not run on its schedule but is not deleted -- you can re-enable it at any time.

## Editing a job

Click the edit icon on a job's row to open the editing form, where you can change the name, description, or schedule.

## Deleting a job

Click the delete icon on a job's row. You will be asked to confirm before the job is permanently removed.
