# Using Falcon Dash on mobile

Falcon Dash is fully functional on phones and tablets. The interface adapts to smaller screens while keeping all the features available on desktop.

## Layout differences from desktop

On mobile, Falcon Dash uses a different layout optimized for touch screens:

**Home screen:** When you open the Chat tab, you see the Agent Rail on the left and the channel list on the right. This replaces the side-by-side layout used on desktop.

**Chat view:** Tapping a channel slides the chat view in from the right, taking up the full screen. A back arrow in the top-left header takes you back to the channel list. You can also use your phone's back gesture or button.

**Bottom tab bar:** Instead of the desktop sidebar links, a bottom tab bar provides quick access to the main sections: Chat, Projects, Jobs, Docs, and Passwords. If you have pinned custom apps, a "More" tab appears as well.

**Threads:** On desktop, threads open in a side panel next to the chat. On mobile, threads open as a full-screen overlay. Tap the X in the header to close the thread and return to the main chat.

## Agent Rail on mobile

The Agent Rail appears on the left side of the home screen, slightly narrower than the desktop version. Tap an agent icon to switch agents. The channel list next to it updates to show the selected agent's channels.

## Touch adaptations

Several elements are adapted for touch interaction:

- **Buttons and tabs** have larger touch targets for easier tapping.
- **The message input** uses a rounded pill shape on mobile with dedicated send and stop buttons sized for thumbs.
- **Message actions** (reply, thread, copy, react) appear when you tap and hold a message, rather than on hover.
- **The bottom tab bar** hides automatically when the on-screen keyboard is open, giving you more room to type.
- **Exec approvals** appear in a bottom sheet that slides up from the bottom of the screen.
- **Notifications** open in a dedicated sheet view rather than a dropdown.

## Feature parity

Everything you can do on desktop works on mobile:

- Chat with your agents in channels.
- Use slash commands like `/new`, `/stop`, and `/reasoning`.
- Search messages across all chats or within the current chat.
- React to messages and reply in threads.
- View and respond to exec approval requests.
- Manage projects, documents, jobs, and passwords through the bottom tab bar.
- Access settings via the "More" sheet or by navigating to the Settings page.

## Installing Falcon Dash to your home screen

You can install Falcon Dash as an app on your phone for faster access and a more native feel. Once installed, it opens in its own window without browser controls.

**On Android (Chrome):**

1. Open Falcon Dash in Chrome.
2. A banner may appear at the bottom of the screen saying "Install Falcon Dashboard." Tap "Install."
3. If the banner does not appear, tap the three-dot menu in the top-right corner and select "Add to Home Screen" or "Install app."
4. Confirm the installation. The Falcon Dash icon will appear on your home screen.

**On iPhone or iPad (Safari):**

1. Open Falcon Dash in Safari.
2. A banner may appear at the bottom of the screen with instructions. If so, follow them.
3. Otherwise, tap the share button (the square with an upward arrow) in the Safari toolbar.
4. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen."
5. Tap "Add" in the top-right corner. The Falcon Dash icon will appear on your home screen.

After installing, you can open Falcon Dash directly from your home screen. It will behave like a native app, running in full screen without the browser address bar.

To dismiss the install prompt if you prefer to keep using Falcon Dash in your browser, tap the X on the banner. It will not appear again.
