Read the PRD at `prd.json` (in the same directory as this file)\n2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)\n3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.\n4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`\n5. Implement that single user story\n6. Run quality checks (e.g., typecheck, lint, test - use whatever your project requires)\n7. Update CLAUDE.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)\n8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`\n9. Update the PRD to set `passes: true` for the completed story\n10. Append your progress to `progress.txt`\n\n## Progress Report Format\n\nAPPEND to progress.txt (never replace, always append):\n```\n## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]\n- What was implemented\n- Files changed\n- **Learnings for future iterations:**\n  - Patterns discovered (e.g., \"this codebase uses X for Y\")\n  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., \"don't forget to update Z when changing W\")\n  - Useful context (e.g., \"the evaluation panel is in component X\")\n---\n```\n\nThe learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.\n\n## Consolidate Patterns\n\nIf you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:\n\n```\n## Codebase Patterns\n- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations\n- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations\n- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components\n```\n\nOnly add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.\n\n## Update CLAUDE.md Files\n\nBefore committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby CLAUDE.md files:\n\n1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified\n2. **Check for existing CLAUDE.md** - Look for CLAUDE.md in those directories or parent directories\n3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:\n   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module\n   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements\n   - Dependencies between files\n   - Testing approaches for that area\n   - Configuration or environment requirements\n\n**Examples of good CLAUDE.md additions:**\n- \"When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync\"\n- \"This module uses pattern Z for all API calls\"\n- \"Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000\"\n- \"Field names must match the template exactly\"\n\n**Do NOT add:**\n- Story-specific implementation details\n- Temporary debugging notes\n- Information already in progress.txt\n\nOnly update CLAUDE.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.\n\n## Quality Requirements\n\n- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)\n- Do NOT commit broken code\n- Keep changes focused and minimal\n- Follow existing code patterns\n\n## Browser Testing (If Available)\n\nFor any story that changes UI, verify it works in the browser if you have browser testing tools configured (e.g., via MCP):\n\n1. Navigate to the relevant page\n2. Verify the UI changes work as expected\n3. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log\n\nIf no browser tools are available, note in your progress report that manual browser verification is needed.\n\n## Stop Condition\n\nAfter completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.\n\nIf ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:\n<promise>COMPLETE</promise>\n\nIf there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).\n\n## Important\n\n- Work on ONE story per iteration\n- Commit frequently\n- Keep CI green\n- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting\n",
