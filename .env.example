# Falcon Dash Environment Variables
#
# No environment variables are required when the OpenClaw gateway runs locally.
# The dashboard reads gateway configuration from ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json.
#
# For remote gateway development (gateway on another machine):
# Copy this file to .env and set both variables below.
#
# GATEWAY_URL=ws://192.168.x.x:18789
# GATEWAY_TOKEN=your-gateway-token
#
# Remote gateway setup (one-time, on the gateway machine):
#   1. Set gateway.bind: "lan" in ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
#   2. Add gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins: ["http://localhost:5173"]
#   3. Approve dev machine pairing: openclaw devices approve
